# ClaudeCodeSystem Setup Repo

> ## THIS REPOSITORY IS PUBLIC AND SHIPS TO CLIENTS
>
> Everything committed here is world-readable and lands in client hands. Verify with
> `gh repo view StackDev223/ClaudeCodeSystem --json visibility` before doubting it.
>
> **Never write into this repo:** client names paired with their systems or security posture, PR
> numbers or their findings, vulnerabilities, credentials, plan or billing state, developer names,
> internal headcount or revenue plans, or any Integral internal process document.
>
> **Internal process and SOP work belongs in the Brain vault** (`Integral/SOPs/`), never here. This
> holds even if a handoff or a previous session names this repo as "the canonical home" for a
> document. A recorded decision is not evidence of visibility.
>
> `docs/superpowers/` is gitignored here as a backstop, because `brainstorming` and `writing-plans`
> write client-specific specs and plans into that path by default.
>
> Only generic, portable, client-facing methodology belongs in this repo.

This is the setup repository for the Claude Code Personal Assistant System. It is NOT a vault -- it contains the templates, examples, and setup commands used to build a vault.

## If the user opens Claude Code in this folder

Guide them to type `/onboard` to begin setup. The skills are in `.claude/commands/` and are ready to use.

## If this folder is inside an Obsidian vault (bootstrap mode)

The user may have downloaded this repo and dropped it inside their existing notes folder. Detect this by checking:
1. Does a parent directory contain `.obsidian/` or other vault files?
2. Is this folder nested (e.g., `Brain/ClaudeCodeSystem-main/` or `Brain/ClaudeCodeSystem/`)?

If yes, **bootstrap automatically**:

1. Identify the vault root (the directory containing `.obsidian/` or the nearest parent that looks like a vault root).
2. Copy all files from this repo's `.claude/commands/` to the vault root's `.claude/commands/`:
   ```
   mkdir -p <vault_root>/.claude/commands/
   cp .claude/commands/*.md <vault_root>/.claude/commands/
   ```
3. Tell the user: "I found the setup files and copied the commands to your vault. You can now type `/onboard` to begin, or I can start it for you."
4. Offer to start `/onboard` immediately.

## If the user just says "set me up" or "help me get started"

Read `.claude/commands/onboard.md` from this repo and execute it directly. The user does not need to know about skills to get started.

## Dual-Format Slash Commands (Code vs CoWork)

Slash commands exist in **two formats** to support both Claude Code (CLI) and Claude CoWork (web app):

| Format | Location | Frontmatter | How Users Get Them |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/commands/` | None needed | Auto-discovered by Claude Code; copied to vault during `/onboard` Phase 6E |
| Claude CoWork | `cowork-commands/` | YAML `---` block with `name:` and `description:` | Manually uploaded by user through the **Customize** section in CoWork settings |

**Maintenance rule: when you create or modify a slash command, you MUST update both versions.** The CoWork version is identical to the Code version except for the YAML frontmatter block at the top of the file:

```yaml
---
name: command-name
description: One-line description of what the command does.
---
```

The `name` field should match the filename (without `.md`). The `description` should be a clear one-liner that helps the user understand when to use the command.

**There is exactly one folder of Code commands: `.claude/commands/`.** (The old `examples/commands/` folder was removed -- it created the illusion that some commands were optional examples, which is how they kept getting dropped during onboarding. All commands are first-class and shipped.)

**To add a new command:**
1. Create the Code version in `.claude/commands/`
2. Copy it to `cowork-commands/` and prepend the YAML frontmatter

That is it. **You do NOT need to register the command anywhere in `onboard.md`.** Phase 6E installs *every* `.md` from `.claude/commands/` (and uploads every file from `cowork-commands/`) with an unconditional glob copy. Any command you add to that folder ships to every user automatically. There is deliberately no hand-maintained install list, because that list is what kept dropping commands during onboarding.

**To modify an existing command:**
1. Edit the Code version (the source of truth)
2. Copy the changes to the matching file in `cowork-commands/` (preserve the YAML frontmatter)

## After setup is complete

This repo is no longer needed. Everything gets copied into the user's vault during `/onboard`. The `/finish` command offers to archive this folder.

## Development workflow

Follow the **Integral development playbook** (brainstorm → slice → plan → build → two-stage review → validation gate → PR → CodeRabbit loop → handoff → human merge). It is maintained as a single canonical copy and deliberately does **not** live in this repo:

> https://github.com/IntegralOrg/ClaudeCodeSystem-Cloud/blob/main/docs/guides/development-process.md

Do not copy it in here. It was duplicated across repos before, the copies drifted, and the drift silently broke the CodeRabbit loop. Read it there, and fix it there.
