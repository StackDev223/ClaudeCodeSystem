## [2026-06-18] - Single Command Folder: Removed examples/commands/, Unconditional Install

### Fixed
- **Commands were silently dropped during onboarding.** `onboard.md` Phase 6E used a hand-enumerated, conditional install list: `morning.md`/`eod.md`/`daily-note.md`/`brain-dump.md` only installed if the user picked the matching Phase 5 workflow preference, and the five EOD phase commands (`eod-gather`, `eod-sync`, `eod-time`, `eod-note`, `eod-today`) were never installed at all. Because `/eod` and its phase commands reference each other, a half-installed pipeline broke mid-run after the user invoked a slash command.

### Changed
- **Phase 6E now installs every command unconditionally** via a glob copy of `.claude/commands/*.md` (minus `onboard.md`), in both the CLI and CoWork paths. Workflow preferences only affect which command is *recommended* and how tool-specific ones are *customized*, never whether a file is installed. There is no longer any hand-maintained install list to fall out of sync.
- **Removed the `examples/commands/` folder.** Its 10 commands (`eod`, `eod-gather`, `eod-sync`, `eod-time`, `eod-note`, `eod-today`, `morning`, `monthly-review`, `brain-dump`, `daily-note`) moved into `.claude/commands/` via `git mv`. There is now exactly one source folder for Code commands. The "examples" framing was the root cause of the drift: it made shipped commands look optional. `examples/` retains only `settings*.json` and `scripts/`.
- **Docs updated**: repo `CLAUDE.md` (Dual-Format table + maintenance rule), `README.md` (repository-structure tree), `docs/vault-design-guide.md`, and `finish.md` (both Code + CoWork copies) no longer reference `examples/commands/`.

## [2026-06-10] - Handoffs Moved Out of .claude/ to .handoffs/

### Changed
- **Handoff storage moved from `.claude/handoffs/` to `.handoffs/` at the working-directory root** (`/handoff`, `/pickup`, `/onboard` Phase 6E, README — both `.claude/commands/` and `cowork-commands/` copies). Claude Code's hardcoded sensitive-file guard prompts on EVERY Write/Edit under `.claude/` directories and cannot be suppressed by permission allow rules, PreToolUse hooks, or PermissionRequest hooks (verified empirically; known open bug anthropics/claude-code#41615, including the dialog's non-persisting "always allow" option). Moving the directory out of `.claude/` is the only way to make handoff writes prompt-free.
- **`/pickup` legacy fallback extended**: if `.handoffs/` is missing or empty but `.claude/handoffs/` has files, read from there and suggest migrating them (covers projects not yet moved).

### Migration
- Per project: `mv .claude/handoffs .handoffs` and gitignore `.handoffs/` (keep the old `.claude/handoffs/` ignore line for stragglers).

## [2026-06-03] - Remove Legacy /resume Command

### Removed
- **`/resume` deleted** (`examples/commands/resume.md` + `cowork-commands/resume.md`) and dropped from the onboard Phase 6E install lists. It drove the obsolete single global `~/.claude/handoff.md` pattern that `/pickup`'s legacy note warns against. Use `/handoff` + `/pickup` (named, per-project, multiple active handoffs) instead.

---

## [2026-06-03] - Handoff/Pickup Promoted to the Standard Command Set

### Changed
- **`/handoff` and `/pickup` moved from `examples/commands/` into the standard set `.claude/commands/`.** They are now core commands every user receives during setup (like `/onboard`, `/strategy`, `/learn`), not optional examples. One source of truth per command.
- **`/pickup` updated to the latest functionality**: explicit "Step 0: Resolve Which Handoff to Read" (lists actual handoffs and asks rather than silently falling back), a legacy-note guard against stale root `handoff.md` orphans hijacking a resume, and split Read / Freshness-check steps.
- **`onboard.md` Phase 6E**: handoff/pickup now install from `.claude/commands/` under an "Always copy these session-continuity skills (every user gets these)" block, with rationale on why they exist (context + task management, hand off / pick up conversations, persistent track record in the vault).
- **`cowork-commands/handoff.md` and `pickup.md`** synced to the new bodies (YAML frontmatter preserved).
- **README**: added a "Session Continuity (`/handoff` and `/pickup`)" key-concept section and listed both in the repository-structure tree under `.claude/commands/`.

### Removed
- `examples/commands/handoff.md` and `examples/commands/pickup.md` (moved to the standard set; no longer duplicated in examples).

## [2026-04-28] - Brainstorming Skill + Local Handoff Files

### Added
- **Brainstorming community skill** installed during onboarding via `npx skills add https://github.com/obra/superpowers --skill brainstorming`
- Added `/brainstorming` to the strategy skills walkthrough in `train.md`

### Changed
- **Handoff/Pickup now write to the current working directory** instead of global `~/.claude/handoff.md`. Each project gets its own `handoff.md`, so multiple projects can have independent active handoffs.
