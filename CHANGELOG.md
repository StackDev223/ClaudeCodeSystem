## [2026-08-17] - Add /vault-audit: Nightly Self-Healing Vault Hygiene

`/monthly-review` catches structural drift once a month, after it has already made the vault harder to search. Nothing ran nightly, so a misfiled file or an unmerged duplicate could sit for weeks before the next full pass found it.

### Added
- **`/vault-audit`** (`.claude/commands/vault-audit.md` + `cowork-commands/vault-audit.md`) -- six-step nightly hygiene pass, fully autonomous: it fixes what it finds and never asks for approval mid-run. Splits the work deliberately: `templates/scripts/vault-audit.py` (stdlib-only Python, copied into the vault at `scripts/vault-audit.py`) owns everything deterministic -- walking the tree, hashing files for change detection, staging removals, purging week-old trash -- while Claude owns everything semantic -- does a file's content match its folder, do two files describe the same thing closely enough to merge, is the schema itself wrong. Neither is safe alone: a script has no notion of meaning, and free-form judgment without a script drifts as fast as the vault it's meant to fix.
- **`.claude/vault-schema.md`** -- the per-vault design contract the audit enforces: a machine-parsed YAML block (root whitelist, protected paths, folder purposes and naming patterns, `no_merge` record folders, required frontmatter) plus prose canonical-home rules. The audit can amend its own YAML when the same misfile recurs 3+ nights running, with every amendment logged to a changelog inside the file -- the schema self-corrects instead of needing a human to notice it's stale.
- **Removals are staged, never deleted.** Every file the audit would remove goes to `.claude/audit-trash/<date>/` first and is purged automatically after 7 days, so a bad call is a `mv` away from reversible, not a `git revert` away.
- **`/eod` Phase 5.5** -- runs the nightly audit after tomorrow's plan is built. Makes its own pre-audit checkpoint commit (`git commit -m "pre-audit checkpoint"`) immediately before invoking the command, so the audit itself never has to touch git and every change it makes in a session is trivially revertable.
- **`/onboard` Phase 6A** -- writes the vault's first `.claude/vault-schema.md` right after the folder structure is created, and copies `templates/scripts/vault-audit.py` into the new vault. Deliberately asks **at most one** plain-language question during setup ("Are there folders I should never reorganize, like a private journal?") -- protected paths are otherwise derived by convention (`Archive/`, `Attachments/`, `Templates/`, dot-folders, generated-output files), never interrogated out of a non-technical user one path at a time.

### Design notes
- Three refinements earned the hard way and worth calling out for anyone extending the command: the exact-duplicate tie-break falls back to the canonically-named file (not raw mtime) when both copies land in the same schema-endorsed folder, since a fresh accidental copy is usually the *newer* file, not the real one; empty-looking stubs get read in full before staging, because a two-line file can still carry a load-bearing fact (an ID, a date, a link); and any workflow that edits a file's content and then reindexes it must `scan` before `update-row`, never after, or the stored hash goes stale and the file re-flags on the very next run.

## [2026-07-28] - Monthly Review v2: The Command Now Repairs the Vault Instead of Reporting On It

`/monthly-review` was a four-question interview bolted to a permission-gated checklist. It asked the user for approval five separate times, marked problems for future attention instead of fixing them, and never touched the two things that actually degrade an agent over time: an unbounded `CLAUDE.md` and a vault whose files have drifted out of any coherent structure.

Field evidence (Beyond Braid "Agent Level Up" call, 2026-07-28, 29:47-32:59): a delivery lead walked a user through the `CLAUDE.md` character count live (31k against the 25k-30k target) and described the monthly review as the thing that "does a diagnostic of how your file's grown and been built over time" -- a diagnostic that did not exist in the shipped command. On the same call, one user had never run the review and another did not know it existed. A third had already hand-patched his own copy with folder-organization checks after a manual cleanup, framing the payoff as "your digital brain and the dots should be more connected versus a bunch of random dots sprawled everywhere." A fourth user's `memory.md` was sitting outside his vault, invisible through months of daily use. A user patching the skill himself is the clearest available signal that the shipped version is under-scoped.

The command is now 8 phases, only one of which is interactive.

### Added
- **Phase 0: Safety Gate (blocking).** No file is deleted, merged, or moved until the vault is confirmed present in a remote Git backup. Checks repo status, remote configuration, uncommitted work, and unpushed commits. On unsaved work it offers once, in plain language, to make the backup, then **re-verifies `git rev-list --count origin/<branch>..HEAD` after pushing** -- a push can report success and still leave commits behind, and treating the exit code as proof would defeat the entire gate.
- **SAFE MODE.** When there is no remote, or the user declines the backup, the run continues rather than aborting: every audit, the `CLAUDE.md` repair, the graph rebuild, the personalization audit, and the coaching phase all still run. Only destructive operations are withheld, collected into a "Waiting on your backup" list, and surfaced in the final report. A client with no remote configured must not get a dead command, because they will never run it again.
- **Phase 4: full knowledge-graph rebuild on every run**, not on request. Ordered deliberately **after** the merge phase; syncing first would index files about to be deleted and leave broken links pointing at them. Reports orphan count (files connected to nothing) as the headline metric, compared against last month.
- **Phase 5: Personalization Audit.** Asks what would improve this vault for this specific person rather than applying generic hygiene. Diagnoses each unused skill as **undiscovered** (the work still happens manually, so teach it) or **unwanted** (the work never happens, so offer to delete it), measures folder gravity, hunts repeated manual work as slash-command candidates, and checks structure fit -- where documentation and real filing behavior disagree, the documentation is treated as wrong, not the user.
- **Topical duplicate detection.** Beyond exact-hash and near-filename passes, a third pass finds the same operational fact restated across three or more files. Hashing cannot find this, and it is the drift that actually degrades an agent, because the copies fall out of sync and the agent starts receiving contradictory instructions.
- **Misplaced agent file detection (Phase 1f).** Searches outside the vault for a stray `memory.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or memory directory, then explains where it was and why it was invisible. The detection always runs; the **move happens in FULL MODE only**, since relocating a file is a destructive operation and SAFE MODE defers it to the pending list.

### Changed
- **Phases 1 through 5 run with no questions asked.** The command no longer requests permission mid-run or presents findings for approval before acting. It fixes, then shows a receipt. There are exactly three remaining interaction points, documented at the top of the command: the one-time backup consent in Phase 0 (only when the vault is unsaved or unpushed), the Phase 6 coaching conversation, and approval of testimonial quotes in Phase 7a before a named client is quoted in writing. The backup gate is what makes the unattended repair in between safe.
- **The four feedback questions are cut to two and moved from the start of the run to the end.** Asked cold they produce shrugs; asked after the user has seen concrete findings they produce specifics. The "monthly 1-on-1 with your agent" framing is retained; the cold-open interrogation is not.
- **Phase 6 coaching replaces the old feedback step.** Root-causes the behavior rather than the symptom ("your instructions file grew 6,000 characters because every call added a guideline and nothing ever removed one," not "the file was too big"), teaches two or three concrete habits, then closes the loop by scheduling the preventive routines and building a slash command for the repeated manual work found in Phase 5, during the run. The command's stated goal is to make itself unnecessary: a user who depends on a monthly cleanup has a broken daily loop.
- **Written throughout for a non-technical reader.** No technical term appears in user-facing output without a plain-language explanation beside it.
- **Duplicate resolution defaults to merge-preserving-both-facts**, with byte-identical copies deleted outright. Nothing unique is lost, which is what makes the merge safe to perform unattended.

### Fixed
- **The `CLAUDE.md` growth diagnostic never existed.** Phase 2 now counts characters against the 25,000-30,000 target and, past 30,000, extracts oversized *reference detail* into `Resources/Reference/` files, leaving pointers, then reports before and after. **Guidelines, rules, and preferences are never extracted** -- an instruction that is not loaded into every conversation is not an instruction, so a size fix must not quietly gut the rules to hit a character target.
- **Nothing was ever actually repaired.** Every phase that previously produced a findings list to review now applies the fix in FULL MODE. In SAFE MODE the non-destructive repairs still apply and the destructive ones are deferred to the pending list rather than silently skipped.
- **Structural drift went unaddressed.** Duplicate files, misfiled notes, empty files and folders, and stale references to concluded work are now found and resolved in Phase 3.
- **Discovery.** Phase 5a explicitly checks whether the user has ever run the monthly review itself; a first run after many months is treated as the most important finding of the run and routed into coaching.

## [2026-07-24] - Add /morning-precheck and /reconcile

Two commands added, adapted for the local edition's iCloud vault and launchd/cron scheduling.

### Added
- **`/morning-precheck`** (`.claude/commands/morning-precheck.md` + `cowork-commands/morning-precheck.md`) -- headless research pass that runs as a scheduled task (macOS `launchd` or Linux `cron`) ~6:30 AM weekdays, before the interactive `/morning`. Fans out parallel Task-tool subagents against Gmail, Slack, Calendar, and Fathom transcripts to verify what is actually still open; auto-marks HIGH-confidence completions in the client Inbox files (Python atomic-write pattern so iCloud sync cannot race between read and write); and writes `Inbox/Morning Precheck.md` for `/morning` to consume. Bakes in three hard-won rules: **done-by-anyone counts** (a teammate resolving the request is done for the user), **full-thread reading** (not just sender-side signals), and **exact-line matching instead of keyword matching** (keyword matches can wrongly check off the wrong task). `AskUserQuestion` is explicitly forbidden -- ambiguous items go to `## Confirm` for `/morning` to ask about later. Deployment guidance for both `com.brain.morning-precheck.plist` (macOS launchd, mirroring the existing eod-runner example) and cron.
- **`/reconcile`** (`.claude/commands/reconcile.md` + `cowork-commands/reconcile.md`) -- interactive light EOD counterpart to `/eod`. Walks the day's time blocks and captures four states per block (done / carried / **skipped** / new-followup) so plan-adherence is honest -- silently dropping missed blocks inflates the metric and hides the pattern the user wants to see. Checks off the client Inbox files (Python atomic writes), patches Google Calendar with actuals prefixed `[done]` / `[carried]` / `[skipped]` so the calendar becomes a historical record of how time was actually spent, and upserts a row into `Work/Daily/Plan Adherence Log.md` (also atomic-write) for day-over-day trend visibility. `/eod` still owns Rize / Fathom / graph / daily-note; this is the fast midday-or-EOD "did I do my blocks?" pass only.

### Design notes
- Both commands use inline `[YOUR_UTC_OFFSET]` and `[YOUR_IANA_TIMEZONE]` placeholders for timezone (not `.env` vars), matching the repo's existing `[Your Timezone]` / `[Client A]` / `[YourCompany]` customization pattern -- one-time swap when installing, not runtime config.
- Both commands use the Python atomic-write pattern for every Inbox edit and for the adherence-log upsert -- consistent with the "Critical rule: Atomic writes" already documented in `/eod-gather`.
- `/reconcile` is intentionally interactive (not a scheduled task). It needs the user present to name exceptions ("which planned blocks did NOT happen?"); a headless variant would either auto-mark everything done (dishonest) or auto-mark everything skipped (useless).

## [2026-06-18] - Single Command Folder: Removed examples/commands/, Unconditional Install

### Fixed
- **Commands were silently dropped during onboarding.** `onboard.md` Phase 6E used a hand-enumerated, conditional install list: `morning.md`/`eod.md`/`daily-note.md`/`brain-dump.md` only installed if the user picked the matching Phase 5 workflow preference, and the five EOD phase commands (`eod-gather`, `eod-sync`, `eod-time`, `eod-note`, `eod-today`) were never installed at all. Because `/eod` and its phase commands reference each other, a half-installed pipeline broke mid-run after the user invoked a slash command.

### Changed
- **Phase 6E now installs every command unconditionally** via a glob copy of `.claude/commands/*.md` (minus `onboard.md`), in both the CLI and CoWork paths. Workflow preferences only affect which command is *recommended* and how tool-specific ones are *customized*, never whether a file is installed. There is no longer any hand-maintained install list to fall out of sync.
- **Removed the `examples/commands/` folder.** Its 10 commands (`eod`, `eod-gather`, `eod-sync`, `eod-time`, `eod-note`, `eod-today`, `morning`, `monthly-review`, `brain-dump`, `daily-note`) moved into `.claude/commands/` via `git mv`. There is now exactly one source folder for Code commands. The "examples" framing was the root cause of the drift: it made shipped commands look optional. `examples/` retains only `settings*.json` and `scripts/`.
- **Docs updated**: repo `CLAUDE.md` (Dual-Format table + maintenance rule), `README.md` (repository-structure tree), `docs/vault-design-guide.md`, and `finish.md` (both Code + CoWork copies) no longer reference `examples/commands/`.

## [2026-06-10] - Handoffs Moved Out of .claude/ to .handoffs/

### Changed
- **Handoff storage moved from `.claude/handoffs/` to `.handoffs/` at the working-directory root** (`/handoff`, `/pickup`, `/onboard` Phase 6E, README — both `.claude/commands/` and `cowork-commands/` copies). Claude Code's hardcoded sensitive-file guard prompts on EVERY Write/Edit under `.claude/` directories and cannot be suppressed by permission allow rules, PreToolUse hooks, or PermissionRequest hooks (verified empirically; known open bug anthropics/claude-code#41615, including the dialog's non-persisting "always allow" option). Moving the directory out of `.claude/` is the only way to make handoff writes prompt-free.
- **`/pickup` legacy fallback extended**: if `.handoffs/` is missing or empty but `.claude/handoffs/` has files, read from there and suggest migrating them (covers projects not yet moved).

### Migration
- Per project: `mv .claude/handoffs .handoffs` and gitignore `.handoffs/` (keep the old `.claude/handoffs/` ignore line for stragglers).

---

## [2026-06-03] - Remove Legacy /resume Command

### Removed
- **`/resume` deleted** (`examples/commands/resume.md` + `cowork-commands/resume.md`) and dropped from the onboard Phase 6E install lists. It drove the obsolete single global `~/.claude/handoff.md` pattern that `/pickup`'s legacy note warns against. Use `/handoff` + `/pickup` (named, per-project, multiple active handoffs) instead.

---

## [2026-06-03] - Handoff/Pickup Promoted to the Standard Command Set

### Changed
- **`/handoff` and `/pickup` moved from `examples/commands/` into the standard set `.claude/commands/`.** They are now core commands every user receives during setup (like `/onboard`, `/strategy`, `/learn`), not optional examples. One source of truth per command.
- **`/pickup` updated to the latest functionality**: explicit "Step 0: Resolve Which Handoff to Read" (lists actual handoffs and asks rather than silently falling back), a legacy-note guard against stale root `handoff.md` orphans hijacking a resume, and split Read / Freshness-check steps.
- **`onboard.md` Phase 6E**: handoff/pickup now install from `.claude/commands/` under an "Always copy these session-continuity skills (every user gets these)" block, with rationale on why they exist (context + task management, hand off / pick up conversations, persistent track record in the vault).
- **`cowork-commands/handoff.md` and `pickup.md`** synced to the new bodies (YAML frontmatter preserved).
- **README**: added a "Session Continuity (`/handoff` and `/pickup`)" key-concept section and listed both in the repository-structure tree under `.claude/commands/`.

### Removed
- `examples/commands/handoff.md` and `examples/commands/pickup.md` (moved to the standard set; no longer duplicated in examples).

---

## [2026-04-28] - Brainstorming Skill + Local Handoff Files

### Added
- **Brainstorming community skill** installed during onboarding via `npx skills add https://github.com/obra/superpowers --skill brainstorming`
- Added `/brainstorming` to the strategy skills walkthrough in `train.md`

### Changed
- **Handoff/Pickup now write to the current working directory** instead of global `~/.claude/handoff.md`. Each project gets its own `handoff.md`, so multiple projects can have independent active handoffs.
