# Connect: Set Up Your Tool Connections

This is Part 3 of 4 in the setup process. The user has already run `/onboard` (built their vault) and `/train` (learned how the system works). Now we connect their actual tools.

**Prerequisites:** CLAUDE.md exists with tool preferences from `/onboard`. `.env` file exists with placeholder comments.

**Voice:** Patient, step-by-step guide. Never assume they know what an API key is or where to find settings in an app. Every instruction should be "click this, then click that."

**Important:** Use `AskUserQuestion` at EVERY step to confirm before moving on. Test EVERY connection with real data before moving to the next tool. Do not leave any tool half-connected.

---

## Step 0: Check Prerequisites

### Runtime Mode

Before anything else, determine which Claude interface the user is using for connections.

AskUserQuestion: "Which Claude interface are you using for this setup?"
Options:
- Claude Desktop app (most likely if you downloaded Claude from the web)
- Claude Code in the terminal / command line
- Both

Set `CLAUDE_RUNTIME` from their answer.

Connection rules:
- **Desktop**: Built-in connectors and MCP-style integrations must be configured in the app UI. Do not rely on writing local `mcpServers` config files for Desktop users.
- **CLI**: Local Claude Code config files are valid. MCP servers can be configured in `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- **Both**: Use the app UI for Desktop connectors. Only add CLI config for tools they also need in terminal sessions. `.env` works for both.

Before connecting any tools, verify the user's machine has what we need. Run these checks silently and only surface issues.

### Python packages

Run: `python3 -c "import markdown, requests" 2>&1`

If it fails (ModuleNotFoundError), tell the user:
"I need to install two small Python packages that the system uses for creating Google Docs and calling APIs. This is a one-time setup."

Run: `pip3 install markdown requests`

If pip3 is not found, try `python3 -m pip install markdown requests`.

If that also fails: "Python's package installer (pip) is not set up. Let me fix that."
Run: `python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade` then retry.

AskUserQuestion: "Python packages installed. Ready to continue?"
Options:
- Yes
- I got an error

### Node.js and npx

Only relevant if `CLAUDE_RUNTIME` includes CLI, or if a local script explicitly needs Node.js. Some CLI MCP servers need Node.js. Check: `npx --version 2>&1`

If npx is not found:

AskUserQuestion: "Some tools need Node.js installed. It is a free runtime -- like a behind-the-scenes engine. Want me to help install it?"
Options:
- Yes
- I already have it, something is wrong with my PATH
- Skip tools that need it

**If yes (macOS):** Check for Homebrew (`brew --version`). If available: `brew install node`. If no Homebrew: "Go to **nodejs.org** and download the LTS installer. Run it and follow the prompts."

**If yes (Linux):** `curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt-get install -y nodejs` (or guide them to nodejs.org).

After install, verify: `npx --version`

AskUserQuestion: "Node.js is ready. Continuing to tool connections."
Options:
- Sounds good

**If everything passes**, skip this step entirely -- no output needed.

---

## Step 1: Figure Out What to Connect

Read CLAUDE.md to find which tools the user selected during `/onboard`. Also read `.env` to see which credentials are still blank.

Present the list:

"During setup, you said you use these tools:"
- [List each tool with a one-line description]

"We are going to connect each one now. I will walk you through every step and test each connection before moving on."

AskUserQuestion: "Which one should we start with?"
Options:
- [List their tools as options, recommending the most impactful one first]
- Just go in order

---

## Step 2: Connect Each Tool

Go through each tool the user selected. After completing each one, say: "[Tool] is connected! [N] more to go. Ready for the next one ([next tool name])?"

**If the user wants to pause**, note which tools are done and which remain. Tell them: "When you come back, type `/connect` and I will pick up with [next tool]."

### Google Calendar and Gmail

**First, determine the connection method:**

AskUserQuestion: "There are two ways to connect Google. Which sounds better to you?"
Options:
- **Easy way (recommended):** Sign in through Claude.ai's settings page. Takes 2 minutes, no technical setup.
- **Full control way:** Use the `gws` CLI to set up your own Google access. This is the preferred custom path if you also want Google Drive and Docs. Cloud Console is the fallback if the CLI is unavailable.
- I am not sure, help me decide

**If they are not sure:** "The easy way is best for most people. It gives Claude access to your calendar and email in about 2 minutes. The only reason to choose the full control way is if you also want Claude to create Google Docs or manage files in Google Drive. If you do, prefer the `gws` CLI. You can always add the full control way later."

---

#### Easy Way: Claude.ai Managed Connections

Walk through step by step with AskUserQuestion confirmations:

1. "Open your browser and go to **claude.ai**. Sign in to your account."

AskUserQuestion: "Are you on the Claude.ai dashboard?"
Options:
- Yes
- I need to create an account first
- I am having trouble signing in

2. "Click your **profile icon** in the bottom-left corner, then click **Settings**."

AskUserQuestion: "Are you on the Settings page?"
Options:
- Yes
- I cannot find the profile icon
- I see something different

3. "In the left sidebar, look for **Integrations** or **Connected Apps**. Click on it."

4. "Find **Google Calendar** and click **Connect**."

5. "Google will ask you to sign in and approve access. Sign in with your work email and click **Allow** on each permissions screen."

AskUserQuestion: "Did Google Calendar connect?"
Options:
- Yes, it shows as connected
- I got an error
- My work account was blocked -- Google says my organization does not allow this

If blocked:
AskUserQuestion: "Your work Google account restricts this. What would you like to do?"
Options:
- Try with my personal Gmail instead
- Switch to the full control way (`gws` CLI / Cloud Console fallback)
- Skip Google for now

6. Repeat for **Gmail** if they want email connected.

7. If `CLAUDE_RUNTIME` includes CLI, update CLI permissions in `~/.claude/settings.json`, adding `"mcp__claude_ai_Google_Calendar__*"` and/or `"mcp__claude_ai_Gmail__*"` to the allow list.
   - If Desktop only: do not write local config here. The connector lives in the app UI.

8. Test the connection:
- "Let me pull up your calendar to make sure it is working..."
- Use the Google Calendar MCP tools to list upcoming events
- Show 3-5 upcoming events

AskUserQuestion: "I found these events on your calendar: [list]. Does that look right?"
Options:
- Yes, that is my calendar!
- Those do not look right
- It returned an error

If successful: "Google Calendar is connected! Claude can now see your schedule, create time blocks, and prep you for meetings."

Repeat test for Gmail if connected.

**Move to the next tool.**

---

#### Full Control Way: `gws` CLI (Cloud Console fallback)

Prefer the `gws` CLI if it is available on the machine. It is the recommended full-control path because it automates most of the Google setup. If `gws` is unavailable or fails, use the Cloud Console fallback below.

This fallback walkthrough assumes the user has never seen Cloud Console and has no existing project.

##### Check Access
"Open your browser and go to **console.cloud.google.com**. Sign in with the Google account you want to use."

AskUserQuestion: "What do you see?"
Options:
- A dashboard or welcome page
- A page asking me to agree to terms of service
- "This service is not available" or a blocked page
- Something else / I am confused

If terms of service: "Click **Agree and Continue**. Let me know when you are through."

If blocked:
AskUserQuestion: "Your organization blocks Cloud Console. What would you like to do?"
Options:
- Switch to the easy way (Claude.ai managed connections) instead
- Try with my personal Gmail account
- Ask IT for access (I will do this later)
- Skip Google for now

##### Create a Project
1. "At the top of the page, click the **project selector dropdown** (it might say 'Select a project' or show a project name)."
2. "Click **New Project** in the top-right corner of the popup."

AskUserQuestion: "Do you see the New Project form?"
Options:
- Yes, I see fields for Project name and Location
- I do not see a New Project button
- I already have a project I want to use

3. "For **Project name**, type **Claude Assistant**. Leave Location as-is. Click **Create**."
4. "Wait a few seconds, then select your new project from the dropdown at the top."

AskUserQuestion: "Are you inside the project? You should see 'Claude Assistant' in the top-left."
Options:
- Yes
- Not sure

##### Enable APIs
"Now we flip the switches to allow access to your Google services."

For each API, one at a time:

**Google Calendar API:**
- "Type **Google Calendar API** in the search bar at the top. Press Enter."
- "Click **Google Calendar API** in the results."
- "Click the blue **Enable** button."

AskUserQuestion: "Does it say enabled?"
Options:
- Yes
- I see an error
- I cannot find it

**Gmail API:**
- "Search bar again: type **Gmail API**. Click it, click **Enable**."

AskUserQuestion: "Gmail API enabled?"
Options:
- Yes
- No / error

**Google Drive API** (only if they want Drive/Docs):
- Same process.

##### OAuth Consent Screen
"Now Google needs to know what app is asking for access. Just a few form fields."

1. "In the left sidebar: **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen**."
   - If no sidebar: "Click the hamburger menu (three lines) top-left, scroll to APIs & Services."

AskUserQuestion: "What do you see?"
Options:
- Choosing between Internal and External
- A consent screen already configured
- Something else

2. If choosing: "Pick **Internal** if available (company account). Otherwise pick **External**. Click **Create**."

3. Fill in the form:
   - "**App name:** Claude Assistant"
   - "**User support email:** Select your email"
   - "**Developer contact:** Your email again at the bottom"
   - "Skip logo and domain fields"
   - "Click **Save and Continue**"

4. Scopes page:
   - "Click **Add or Remove Scopes**"
   - "Search for and check:"
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify`
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` (if applicable)
   - "Click **Update**, then **Save and Continue**"

5. Test Users (External only):
   - "Click **Add Users**, enter your email, click **Add**, then **Save and Continue**"

6. Summary: "Click **Back to Dashboard**"

AskUserQuestion: "Did you get through the consent screen?"
Options:
- Yes, I am back at the dashboard
- I got stuck
- Error about organization policies

##### Create Credentials
1. "Left sidebar: **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**"
2. "Click **+ Create Credentials** > **OAuth client ID**"

AskUserQuestion: "Do you see the form?"
Options:
- Yes, asking for Application type
- Error about consent screen
- Something else

3. "**Application type:** Desktop app. **Name:** Claude Assistant. Click **Create**."

4. "A popup shows your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Copy both now. You can also click **Download JSON**."

AskUserQuestion: "Did you copy both values?"
Options:
- Yes, I have them
- I closed the popup (walk them to Credentials page to find it)
- Something went wrong

##### Get Refresh Token
"Last step. One-time sign-in to get a long-lasting key."

1. "New tab: **developers.google.com/oauthplayground**"
2. "Click the **gear icon** (top-right). Check **Use your own OAuth credentials**. Paste your Client ID and Secret. Click **Close**."
3. "On the left, find and check:"
   - Google Calendar API v3: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
   - Gmail API v1: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify`
   - (Drive if applicable)
4. "Click **Authorize APIs**."
5. "Sign in and click **Allow**."
   - "If you see 'Google hasn't verified this app': click **Advanced** > **Go to Claude Assistant (unsafe)**. This is normal for personal projects."
6. "Click **Exchange authorization code for tokens**."
7. "Copy the **Refresh token** (long string starting with `1//`)."

AskUserQuestion: "Did you get the refresh token?"
Options:
- Yes
- Error during authorization
- No refresh token showing
- I got lost

##### Save and Test
Save all three values to their `.env` file:
```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<value>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<value>
GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=<value>
```

Ask the user to paste each value.

Test:
```bash
source "<vault_path>/.env"
ACCESS_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token" \
  --data "grant_type=refresh_token&client_id=${GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}&client_secret=${GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET}&refresh_token=${GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN}" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access_token'])")
curl -s "https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events?maxResults=3&timeMin=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; events=json.load(sys.stdin).get('items',[]); [print(f'  {e.get(\"summary\",\"(no title)\")}') for e in events[:3]]" 2>/dev/null
```

AskUserQuestion: "I found these events: [list]. Look right?"
Options:
- Yes!
- Not right
- Error

If successful: "Google is connected!"

**Move to the next tool.**

---

### ClickUp

Walk through every step:

1. "Open **ClickUp** in your browser and sign in."

2. "Click your **avatar** (bottom-left), then **Settings**."

AskUserQuestion: "Are you in ClickUp Settings?"
Options:
- Yes
- Cannot find settings

3. "In the left sidebar, click **Apps** (or **Integrations**). Look for **API Token**. Click **Generate** if needed. Copy the token."

AskUserQuestion: "Got the API token?"
Options:
- Yes
- Cannot find the API Token section
- Error

4. Save to `.env`:
```
CLICKUP_API_KEY=<token>
```

5. **Choose the connection path based on `CLAUDE_RUNTIME`.**

**If Desktop or Both:**
- Check whether ClickUp is available in the app's connector/integration UI.
- If yes, walk the user through connecting it there. Do not rely on a local `mcpServers` file for Desktop.
- If no Desktop connector exists, keep the API token in `.env` and treat ClickUp as an API-based integration for now.

**If CLI or Both and they want terminal support too:**
- Read `~/.claude/settings.json`. Add a `mcpServers` block for ClickUp (merge with existing mcpServers if any):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clickup": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic/mcp-remote", "https://mcp.clickup.com/s/mc_live_XXX"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** The exact server URL or package depends on the ClickUp MCP server version available at setup time. Use WebSearch to find the current ClickUp MCP server setup command if the above does not work. Common alternatives:
- `npx -y @anthropic/mcp-remote https://mcp.clickup.com/s/<connection_id>` (ClickUp's hosted MCP)
- `npx -y clickup-mcp-server` (community package with `CLICKUP_API_KEY` env var)

If using an API-key-based server, pass the key via the env block:
```json
{
  "clickup": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "clickup-mcp-server"],
    "env": {
      "CLICKUP_API_KEY": "<their token>"
    }
  }
}
```

After writing the CLI config, tell the user: "I have added the ClickUp connection to your CLI settings. Let me test it."

6. **Test the connection.**
- If they connected ClickUp through a Desktop connector or CLI MCP server, use the ClickUp tools to list their workspaces or spaces. Show results.
- If they are using the API-token fallback, test with a lightweight ClickUp API call using the token saved in `.env`.

AskUserQuestion: "I found these ClickUp spaces: [list]. Right?"
Options:
- Yes!
- Something is off
- Error / no results

**If error:** Read the error message. Common fixes:
- "command not found" → Node.js/npx is not installed (go back to Step 0)
- "unauthorized" → API key is wrong, ask them to regenerate
- "ENOTFOUND" → server URL is wrong, search for the current package name

If successful: "ClickUp is connected! I can now create tasks, update statuses, and sync your vault with ClickUp."

**Move to next tool.**

### Fathom (Meeting Transcripts)

1. "Open **fathom.video** and sign in."

2. "Go to your **Settings** (profile icon or menu)."

AskUserQuestion: "In Fathom settings?"
Options:
- Yes
- Cannot find settings

3. "Look for **API**, **Integrations**, or **Developer**. Find your API key or generate one."

AskUserQuestion: "Got the API key?"
Options:
- Yes
- Cannot find it (may require a specific Fathom plan)
- My plan does not seem to include this

If plan issue: "Fathom API access may require a paid plan. We can skip this for now and use manual transcript processing. Or check fathom.video/pricing to see which plan includes API."

4. Save to `.env`:
```
FATHOM_API_KEY=<key>
```

5. Test:
```bash
source "<vault_path>/.env"
curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: ${FATHOM_API_KEY}" \
  "https://api.fathom.ai/external/v1/meetings?limit=3" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; meetings=json.load(sys.stdin).get('meetings',[]); [print(f'  {m.get(\"title\",\"(no title)\")} -- {m.get(\"date\",\"\")}') for m in meetings[:3]]" 2>/dev/null
```

AskUserQuestion: "Found these meetings: [list]. Look right?"
Options:
- Yes!
- No meetings (might be new)
- Error

If successful: "Fathom is connected! Your call transcripts will be pulled automatically during end-of-day."

**Move to next tool.**

---

### Slack

   - `im:read`
   - `mpim:history`
   - `mpim:read`
   - `users:read`

AskUserQuestion: "All 8 scopes added?"
Options:
- Yes
- Cannot find where to add scopes
- Some are not available

6. "Scroll up: **Install to Workspace** > **Allow**."
7. "Copy the **User OAuth Token** (starts with `xoxp-`)."

AskUserQuestion: "Got the token?"
Options:
- Yes
- No token showing
- Error during install

8. Save to `.env`:
```
SLACK_TOKEN_WORKSPACE_A=<token>
```

9. Test:
```bash
source "<vault_path>/.env"
curl -s "https://slack.com/api/conversations.list?types=public_channel&limit=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${SLACK_TOKEN_WORKSPACE_A}" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; chs=json.load(sys.stdin).get('channels',[]); [print(f'  #{c[\"name\"]}') for c in chs[:5]]" 2>/dev/null
```

AskUserQuestion: "Found these channels: [list]. Your workspace?"
Options:
- Yes!
- Not right
- Error

If they have multiple workspaces: "Want to connect the next workspace now?" Repeat for each.

**Move to next tool.**

2. "Go to account settings."
3. "Find API key and copy it."

AskUserQuestion: "Got it?"
Options:
- Yes
- Cannot find it
- My plan might not include API

4. Save to `.env` and test.

**Move to next tool.**

---

### Other Tools

For tools not covered above (Asana, Trello, Todoist, Teams, Otter, Fireflies, Toggl, Harvest, etc.):

**First, check if an app connector or MCP server exists for the tool.** Use WebSearch: `"[tool name] Claude connector"`, `"[tool name] MCP server" claude`, or `"[tool name] model context protocol"`.

**If a Desktop connector exists and `CLAUDE_RUNTIME` includes Desktop:**
1. Walk the user through connecting it in the app UI
2. Test with a lightweight tool call
3. Update CLAUDE.md integrations section

**If a CLI MCP server exists and `CLAUDE_RUNTIME` includes CLI:**
1. Search for the install command (usually `npx -y @some-org/mcp-server-toolname`)
2. Walk the user through getting credentials (API key, OAuth token, etc.)
3. Save credentials to `.env`
4. Add the `mcpServers` entry to `~/.claude/settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "toolname": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@some-org/mcp-server-toolname"],
         "env": {
           "TOOL_API_KEY": "<value from .env>"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
5. Add `"mcp__toolname__*"` to the `permissions.allow` array in `~/.claude/settings.json`
6. Test with a lightweight MCP tool call
7. Update CLAUDE.md integrations section (add to "Direct Connections")

**If no usable Desktop connector or CLI MCP server exists:**
1. Search for the tool's REST API documentation
2. Walk the user through getting an API key or personal access token
3. Save to `.env`
4. Test with a curl call
5. Update CLAUDE.md integrations section (add to "Tools That Need Login Credentials")

**For Python-based tools** (scripts that need pip packages):
1. Check if the required packages are installed: `python3 -c "import packagename" 2>&1`
2. If missing: `pip3 install packagename`
3. Document the dependency in the script's docstring and in CLAUDE.md under Local Tools

---

## Step 3: Final Check

When all tools are connected (or explicitly skipped):

### Verify connector setup

If `CLAUDE_RUNTIME` includes CLI, read `~/.claude/settings.json` and confirm:
1. Every connected CLI MCP server has an entry in `mcpServers`
2. Every CLI MCP server has a matching `"mcp__servername__*"` entry in `permissions.allow`
3. No placeholder values remain (no `your_...` or `<token>` strings in env blocks)

If anything is missing, fix it now.

### Verify .env

Read the vault's `.env` and confirm:
1. Every API-based tool has its credential filled in (not placeholder)
2. No commented-out credentials for tools that were successfully connected

### Verify CLAUDE.md

Read CLAUDE.md and confirm:
1. Connected tools are listed under the correct section (Direct Connections or Tools That Need Login Credentials)
2. Skipped tools are removed or commented out
3. Any new Local Tools scripts are documented

### Present the summary

"Here is where we stand:"
- List each tool with ✓ (connected and tested) or ○ (skipped, with reason)
- Note which tools were connected in the Desktop app UI, which were configured for CLI, and which credentials were saved in `.env`

Then: "All your tools are connected and tested. The last step is `/finish` -- I will show you the system in action with your real data and teach you how to get the most out of it over time. Type `/finish` when you are ready."
