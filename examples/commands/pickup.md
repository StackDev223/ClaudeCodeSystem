# Pickup

Pick up a handed-off conversation. Reads `handoff.md` from the current working directory, pulls the context it lists, and reports back where we left off so Stephen can keep moving without re-explaining anything.

Pair with `/handoff` (which writes the file in the previous session). Named `/pickup` (not `/resume`) to avoid shadowing Claude Code's built-in `/resume` session picker.

---

## Step 1: Read the Handoff File

Read `handoff.md` from the current working directory.

- **If the file does not exist**: Tell Stephen `No handoff found in the current directory. Nothing to resume -- either run /handoff in a previous session first, or just tell me what you're working on.` Stop.
- **If the file exists**: Continue to Step 2.
- **Note the "Working directory" line** from the handoff header. If it doesn't match the current `pwd`, tell Stephen and ask whether to `cd` into the handoff's working dir or operate from the current one before loading any context.

## Step 2: Freshness Check

Run `date` and compare to the timestamp in the handoff's `# Handoff -- [Topic] -- [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM ET]` header.

- **Under 6 hours old**: Fresh. Proceed.
- **6-24 hours old**: Note this to Stephen in the summary (`Handoff is [N] hours old -- state may have drifted`) but proceed.
- **Over 24 hours old**: Warn Stephen explicitly before loading context: `Handoff is [N] days old. State has almost certainly drifted since then. Want me to resume from it anyway, or start fresh?` Wait for confirmation.

## Step 3: Load the Context

Parse the `## Load This Context Before Responding` section of the handoff file. For each listed item:

- **Read:** entries -- use the Read tool on the exact path (and line range if given)
- **Bash:** entries -- run via Bash tool
- **Check memory:** entries -- Read the file from the memory directory for the project named in the handoff's "Working directory" line. For the Brain vault, that's `~/.claude/projects/-Users-stephendickerson-Library-Mobile-Documents-iCloud-md-obsidian-Documents-Brain/memory/[filename]`. For other projects, the path follows the pattern `~/.claude/projects/<escaped-cwd>/memory/`.
- **Grep/Glob:** entries -- use the appropriate tool

Run all independent reads/commands **in parallel** in a single tool-call block. Do not serialize them.

If any context item fails (file moved, command errors, memory entry missing), note it but continue -- don't abort the resume. A stale pointer is information: it tells you something changed since the handoff was written.

## Step 4: Sanity-Check Against Reality

The handoff is a snapshot. Before trusting it, verify the parts that could have changed:

- If the handoff references uncommitted git state, run `git status` and compare
- If it references a file at a specific line number, confirm the line numbers still match after your Read
- If it says "waiting on Stephen to decide X", note that the question is still open
- If it says something is "running in the background", check whether it actually still is

If reality diverges from the handoff in a way that affects the next steps, flag it in your summary.

## Step 5: Report Back

Give Stephen a compact resume summary. Target: under 200 words. Format:

```
Resumed from handoff written [relative time, e.g., "2h ago" or "yesterday 4:30 PM"].

**Goal:** [one line from handoff]

**Where we left off:** [2-3 sentences synthesizing current state -- your own words, not a copy-paste from the file]

**Loaded context:** [N files, M commands] -- [one-line summary of anything surprising you found, or "matches handoff" if nothing changed]

**Next step:** [first concrete action from the handoff's Next Steps list]

[If there are open questions for Stephen from the handoff, list them here as a short bulleted block. Otherwise omit.]

[If reality diverged from the handoff, flag it here in 1-2 lines. Otherwise omit.]

Ready to continue. Want me to proceed with [next step], or something different?
```

Do not dump the full handoff into the chat. Stephen wrote it (via the previous session) -- he doesn't need to re-read it. Your job is to prove you understood it and are ready to pick up the thread.

## Step 6: Wait for Go-Ahead

Stop after the summary. Wait for Stephen to confirm or redirect before taking any action on the actual work. Resuming is about re-establishing shared context, not auto-executing. Stephen may want to change direction now that he's back in the chair.

## Notes

- **Don't delete `handoff.md`** after reading. Leave it in place -- if Stephen clears again mid-session, the previous handoff is still there as a fallback until `/handoff` overwrites it.
- **If the handoff's "Working directory" differs from `pwd`**, the handoff was written from a different location. Ask Stephen whether to operate from the current directory or the one recorded in the handoff.
- **If Stephen runs `/pickup` without ever having run `/handoff`**, the file won't exist. Don't try to synthesize a pickup from thin air -- just tell him there's nothing to resume.
